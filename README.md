# ANEVA
ANalysis of Expression VAriance

Package developed by: Pejman Mohammadi (firstname@Scripps.edu). See our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/05/09/632794.full.pdf) for method descritions.

This Matlab package allows you to estimate the amount of genetic variation in regulation in a population using a population AE data. `Run_Example.m` allows you to do a demo run of ANEVA on a set of 20 sample AE data files. The package includes all inputs and output for the example data. 

To run the demo you have to first decompress all data files (```gunzip -r ANEVA/01_Data```). Also you should include [Pejtools](https://github.com/PejLab/Pejtools) in your Matlab path.
